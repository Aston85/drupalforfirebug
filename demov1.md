### More Information

This is a blank page for testing the Drupal for Firebug firefox extention.

There is no real content on this page. Instead I have appened the api markup to the bottom of this html document.

In order to see the content on this page you will have to be running firefox with both the firebug, and drupal for firebug extensions installed.
