Version 2.2.1 doens't have any new features and only comes with some bug fixes and improved stability.

2.2.1 does mark some changes (or improvements) to the development workflow for the project.

## Improvements

### Grunt based workflow

One of the reasons that some of the improvements that I have been planning for this project has been so long in coming is because working on Firebug extensions is a huge pain. Some of that has gone away. 

When new changes to the Mozilla API broke some of the Drupal For Firebug functionallity I desided to get things working again. I was no longer working on the same maching that I was before so this meant setting up my new machine for firebug development. This is a bit of a pain, as is the build process for building the xpi.

I took a look at the Dreditor extension's workflow and saw that they where using grunt for this. It looked useful so now the build and even the loading of the xpi is done through grunt commands.

### Move to github

More to come...
